1. How do you handle newlines in encoded string?
2. Should encodeBuffer null-terminate the string?
	- Seems like it would be nice and useful
3. Encoding and decoding the empty string?
4. Decoding a file: should the file always have the same number of base64 characters in every line? Can we create security bugs if we let lines have an arbitrary number of base64 characters?
